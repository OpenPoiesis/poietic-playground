# Poietic Playground

Experimental playground for creating and running models.

Idea is to have a virtual laboratory as an educational tool/toy for modelling,
simulation and reasoning.

See [Open Poiesis](https://www.poietic.org) for more information.

## Reqiurements

This is a [Godot](http://godotengine.org) application that is using SwiftGodot plug-in for simulation
libraries written in Swift.

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) (version >= 4.3)
- [Poietic Godot extension](https://github.com/OpenPoiesis/poietic-godot)

Automatic dependencies (no need to install):
	
- [SwiftGodot](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodot)
- [Poietic Flows](https://github.com/OpenPoiesis/poietic-flows)
- [Poietic Core](https://github.com/OpenPoiesis/poietic-core)

## Build

The build process is a bit convoluted right now. Process will be simplified
and described here.

For now, follow Poietic Godot and Swift Godot instructions linked above.
